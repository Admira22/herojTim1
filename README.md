Full Stack application made in React with DJANGO and SQLite. HEROJ APP is an app for the first aid. The task was to make an app with the specifications below. The app has two modules - unregistered user and registered user.

## Unregistered user 

An unregistered user can see several diseases on the home page, when he clicks on the disease he can see more details. Users can search for diseases - this is a smart search. The user can choose the option to register on the system.

## Registered user

The registered user can log in. The user has access to a smart search when he needs it. In addition, he has the opportunity to see five first-aid lessons. With these lessons, the user prepares himself for the final test. 
Within the lesson, he can see the pictures and the video related to the lesson (located in the database), and he can click the button at the end of the lesson that tells us that he has viewed the lesson. <br>
He can take the final test only after seeing all the lessons. The final test consists of 10 questions, and if the user answers at least 8 questions correctly, he receives a certificate of having passed the test, otherwise, he has the option to take the test again. Within each lesson, he can access questions that represent the preparation for the final test.<br> On the main page, users can view news from their local Red Cross. He can also read blogs written by experts on various health-related topics.
